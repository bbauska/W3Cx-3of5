Online Code Editors:
JS Bin: https://jsbin.com (JS Bin tutorial)
CodePen: https://codepen.io (CodePen tutorial)
Web Editors:
While any text editor, like NotePad or TextEdit, can be used to create Web pages, they don't necessarily offer a lot of help towards that end. Other options offer more facilities for error checking, syntax coloring and saving some typing by filling things out for you.
Here are a few possibilities for Web editors:
•	Notepad - on Windows PC's
•	Visual Studio Code - a free open source editor that can run on any operating system. Many developers are already familiar with Visual Studio Code. Many coding videos in this course are demonstrated using Visual Studio Code.
•	XCode - Mac developers may be familiar with XCode
•	TextEdit - this is available on Macs, but be sure you're saving as plain text, not as a ".rtf" or ".doc" file.
•	Sublime Text - it is quite popular with developers, though there can be a bit of a learning curve to use its many features.
•	BlueGriffon - a WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get") content editor for the World Wide Web. Powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, it's a modern and robust solution to edit Web pages in conformance to the latest Web Standards.
•	Atom - another cross platform editor, created by GitHub.
•	GitHub itself - check this resource that explains how to create a Web site using GitHub.
•	Vim or Emacs - great editors, but if you're not already familiar with these, this isn't the time to try.
Online Editors:
To help you practice during the whole duration of the course, we use the following interactive online editors. Pretty much all the course's examples actually use these tools.
•	  JS Bin (https://jsbin.com/)
JS Bin is an open source collaborative Web development debugging tool. Most of the examples that are in this course are on JSBin.

Tutorials can be found on the Web (such as this one) or on YouTube. The tool is really simple, just open the link to the provided examples, look at the code, look at the result, etc. And you can modify the examples as you like, you can also modify / clone / save / share them. Keep in mind that it's always better to be logged in (it's free) if you do not want to lose your contributions/personal work.
•	  CodePen (https://codepen.io/)
CodePen is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code editor that previews/ showcases your code bits in your browser. It helps with cross-device testing, real-time remote pair programming and teaching.
Here's an article of interest if you use CodePen: Things you can do with CodePen [Brent Miller, February 6, 2019].
There are many other handy tools such as JSFiddle, and Dabblet. Please share your favorite tool on the discussion forum, and explain why! Share also your own code contributions, such as a nice canvas animation, a great looking HTML5 form, etc.
Browser Compatibility:
The term browser compatibility refers to the ability of a given Web site to appear fully functional on the browsers available in the market.
The most powerful aspect of the Web is what makes it so challenging to build for: its universality. When you create a Web site, you’re writing code that needs to be understood by many different browsers on different devices and operating systems!
To make the Web evolve in a sane and sustainable way for both users and developers, browser vendors work together to standardize new features, whether it’s a new HTML element, CSS property, or JavaScript API. But different vendors have different priorities, resources, and release cycles — so it’s very unlikely that a new feature will land on all the major browsers at once. As a Web developer, this is something you must consider if you’re relying on a feature to build your site.
We are then providing references to the browser support of HTML5 features presented in this course using 2 resources: Can I Use and Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs.
Can I use
Can I Use provides up-to-date tables for support of front-end Web technologies on desktop and mobile Web browsers. Below is a snapshot of what information is given by CanIUse when searching for "CSS3 colors".
 
MDN Web Docs
 
To help developers make these decisions consciously rather than accidentally, MDN Web Docs provides browser compatibility tables in its documentation pages, so that when looking up a feature you’re considering for your project, you know exactly which browsers will support it.

W3C Validators: 
For over 15 years, the W3C has been developing and hosting free and open source tools used every day by millions of Web developers and Web designers. All the tools listed below are Web-based, and are available as downloadable sources or as free services on the W3C Developers tools site.
W3C Validator
The W3C validator checks the markup validity of various Web document formats, such as HTML. Note that you are automatically directed to the Nu Html Checker when validating an HTML5 document.
CSS Validator
The CSS validator checks Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (X)HTML documents that use CSS stylesheets.
 
Unicorn
Unicorn is W3C's unified validator, which helps people improve the quality of their Web pages by performing a variety of checks. Unicorn gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services, such as Internationalization, RSS/Atom feeds and http headers.
Internationalization Checker
The W3C Internationalization Checker provides information about various internationalization-related aspects of your page, including the HTTP headers that affect it. It will also report a number of issues and offer advice about how to resolve them.
Link Checker
The W3C Link Checker looks for issues in links, anchors and referenced objects in a Web page, CSS style sheet, or recursively on a whole Web site. For best results, it is recommended to first ensure that the documents checked use valid (X)HTML Markup and CSS.
W3C Cheatsheet
The W3C cheatsheet provides quick access to useful information from a variety of specifications published by W3C. It aims at giving in a very compact and mobile-friendly format a compilation of useful knowledge extracted from W3C specifications, completed by summaries of guidelines developed at W3C, in particular Web accessibility guidelines, the Mobile Web Best Practices, and a number of internationalization tips.
 
Its main feature is a lookup search box, where one can start typing a keyword and get a list of matching properties/elements/attributes/functions in the above-mentioned specifications, and further details on those when selecting the one of interest.
The W3C cheatsheet is only available as a pure Web application.
Help Build the Web Platform
Most of the technologies you use when developing Web applications and Web sites are designed and standardized in W3C in a completely open and transparent process.
In fact, all W3C specifications are developed in public GitHub repositories, so if you are familiar with GitHub, you already know how to contribute to W3C specifications! This is all about raising issues (with feedback and suggestions) and/or bringing pull requests to fix identified issues.
Contribute
Contributing to this standardization process might be a bit scary or hard to approach at first, but understanding at a deeper level how these technologies are built is a great way to build your expertise.
 
If you're looking to an easy way to dive into this standardization processes, check out which issues in the W3C GitHub repositories have been marked as "good first issue" and see if you find anything where you think you would be ready to help.
Shape the future
 
Another approach is to go and bring feedback on ideas for future technologies: the W3C Web Platform Community Incubator Group was built as an easy place to get started to provide feedback on new proposals or bring brand-new proposals for consideration.
Happy Web building!
What is W3C?
As steward of global Web standards, W3C's mission is to safeguard the openness, accessibility, and freedom of the World Wide Web from a technical perspective.
W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web. The widely adopted Web standards define key parts of what actually makes the World Wide Web work.
A few history bits
 
Tim Berners-Lee at his desk in CERN, 1994
Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal in 1989 for a system called the World Wide Web. He then created the first Web browser, server, and Web page. He wrote the first specifications for URLs, HTTP, and HTML.
In October 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Computer Science [MIT/LCS] in collaboration with CERN, where the Web originated (see information on the original CERN Server), with support from DARPA and the European Commission.
In April 1995, Inria became the first European W3C host, followed by Keio University of Japan (Shonan Fujisawa Campus) in Asia in 1996. In 2003, ERCIM took over the role of European W3C Host from Inria. In 2013, W3C announced Beihang University as the fourth Host.
In addition to these four Host locations that employ W3C staff, there are W3C Offices around the globe that support the developer communities in their regions and organize local events. Find the one next to your place!
A few figures
As of June 2020, W3C:
•	Is a member-driven organization composed of nearly 430 companies, universities, start-ups, etc. from all over the world.
•	Holds 44 technical groups, including Working and Interest Groups where technical specifications are discussed and developed.
•	Published over 7,181 published technical reports, including 430 Web standards (or W3C Recommendations) - since January 1st,1995.
•	Runs a translation program to foster the translation of its specifications: see the translation matrix currently listing 304 available translations of W3C recommendations.
•	Hosts 337 Community and Business Groups, where developers, designers, and anyone passionate about the Web have a place to hold discussions and publish ideas.
•	Gathers over12,912active participants constituting the W3C community.
•	Has a technical staff composed of 64 people, spread on all five continents.
The Web is Amazing!
People often use the words "Internet" and "Web" interchangeably, but this usage is technically incorrect.
The Web is an application of the Internet. The Web is the most popular way of accessing the Internet, but other applications of the Internet are e-mail and ftp for example. One analogy equates the Internet to a road network where the Web is a car, the email is a bicycle, etc.  Read this article for more details about the difference between Internet and the Web.
Internet
•	A global network of networks and computers.
•	The network infrastructure.
•	Information travels via network protocols.
•	Can access through a variety of ways.
Web
•	A collection of information accessed through the internet.
•	Information travels primarily through HTTP.
•	Uses browsers to access documents and web pages.
•	Navigation to other pages occurs through hyperlinks.
The internet is a global network of billions of servers, computers, and other hardware devices. Each device can connect with any other device as long as both are connected to the internet using a valid IP address. The internet makes the information sharing system known as the web possible.
The web, which is short for World Wide Web, is one of the ways information is shared on the internet (others include email, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and instant messaging services). The web is composed of billions of connected digital documents that are viewed in a web browser, such as Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and others.
Think of the internet as a library. Think of the books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, audiobooks, and other media it contains as websites.
Both the internet and the web serve unique purposes but work hand in hand to provide information, entertainment, and other services to the public.
The internet really is the information superhighway. It passes through various kinds of network traffic including, FTP, IRC, and the World Wide Web. Without it, we wouldn't have our favorite and most common way to access websites.
The internet was born in the 1960s under the name ARPAnet. It was an experiment by the U.S. military to find ways to maintain communications in the case of a nuclear strike. With a decentralized network, communications could be maintained even if parts were taken offline. ARPAnet eventually became a civilian effort, connecting university mainframe computers for academic purposes.
As personal computers became mainstream in the 1980s and 1990s and the internet was opened to commercial interests, it grew exponentially. More and more users plugged their computers into the massive network through dial-up connections, then through faster connections such as ISDN, cable, DSL, and other technologies. Today, the internet has grown into a public spiderweb of interconnected devices and networks.
No single entity owns the internet, and no single government has absolute authority over its operation. Some technical rules, and its hardware and software standards, are agreed upon by invested organizations, groups, businesses, and others. These groups help the internet remain functional and accessible. However, for the most part, the internet is a free and open broadcast medium of networked hardware with no single owner.
Most consumers are familiar with and comfortable with the World Wide Web. With its easy-to-use interface, it's the best way to get information in a few clicks.
The World Wide Web was born in 1989. Interestingly enough, the web was built by research physicists so that they could share research findings with one another's computers. Today, that idea has evolved into the greatest collection of human knowledge in history.
The credited inventor of the World Wide Web is Tim Berners-Lee.
You have to access the internet to view the World Wide Web and the web pages or other content it contains. The web is the collective name for all the pages, sites, documents, and other media that are served to visitors.
The web consists of digital documents, referred to as web pages, that are viewable through web browser software on devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers. These pages contain many types of content, including static content like encyclopedia pages, but also dynamic content like eBay sales, stocks, weather, news, and traffic reports.
A collection of connected web pages that are publicly accessible and under a single domain name is referred to as a website.
Web pages are connected using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the coding language that allows you to visit any public web page. By clicking a hyperlink or entering a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the browser uses this unique address to find and access a web page. Search engines like Google make it easy to filter the billions of web pages now populating the web by locating the articles, videos, and other media you want to find based on your search criteria.
Final Verdict: You Can't Have the Web Without the Internet
Plain and simple, the internet allows access to the World Wide Web. Without it, we have no way of accessing the thousands of websites out there. For most online needs, however, the web is the easiest to use. Each serves an important purpose.
Why Accessibility is Important
The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.
Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web
The Web has become an essential aspect of our daily lives, and everyone should have access to this technology. Web accessibility focuses on ensuring equivalent access for people with disabilities. It is increasingly important to many organizations and governments from around the world, and has many business benefits. Access to information, including on the Web, is also recognized by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
Who is impacted?
Web accessibility addresses all disabilities, including hearing, learning and cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Some examples of Web accessibility features include:
•	Captions on audio and multimedia content for people who are hard of hearing;
•	Clear and consistent layout for people with learning and cognitive disabilities;
•	Keyboard support for people with physical disabilities and who do not use a mouse;
•	Text alternatives for people with visual disabilities and who are using screen readers;
Web accessibility benefits people with and without disabilities
Web accessibility features also benefit many more users, such as:
•	People with temporary situational limitations, such as a broken arm;
•	People using mobile devices, televisions, and other access channels;
•	People using older computers, with low bandwidth, and other limitations;
•	People who are new to computers, to the Web, or to your own Web site;
•	People who are not fluent in the language of your particular Web site;
The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. When Web pages, Web technologies, Web tools, or Web applications are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web. More information is available in the W3C Accessibility overview.
First Steps in Web Accessibility
There are many simple Web accessibility improvements that you can implement and check right away, even when you are new to this topic.
Remember that when developing or redesigning a website or Web application, it is best to evaluate accessibility early and throughout the development process to identify accessibility problems early, when it is easier to address them.
Two examples are provided below  but you can find more tips and information in these 2 resources:
•	Tips for Getting Started with Web Accessibility
•	Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility
Example #1: page title
Good page titles are particularly important for orientation — to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different Web page is the page title. In the Web page markup, they are the words <title> within the <head>.
Check #1: There is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of a page, and it distinguishes the page from other Web pages.
Example:
<head>
...
<title>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) - home page</title>
...
</head>
Example 2: image text alternatives ("alt text")
Text alternatives ("alt text") are a primary way of making visual information accessible, because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech.
Check #2: Every image has alt with appropriate alternative text.
Example: See the W3C logo below. It contains a link that points to the W3C Web site. The text alternative is going to be a brief description of the link target.

History
As Web site layouts evolve, HTML5 structural elements such as lists, paragraphs, tables, etc. show their limits. Today, many Web sites offer navigation menus, tabbed panels, headers, footers, and so on. The way these "parts"' are implemented relies heavily on <div> and <span> elements with different id and class attributes, lots of CSS and lots of JavaScript code to apply custom styles and behaviors.
However, there are some issues with this approach:
•	id and class names differ from one developer to another, from one country to another, etc.
•	Even with the same ids and class names, the css rules may be different
•	JavaScript libraries have become increasingly heavy over the years
•	Web pages have become increasingly heavy over the years!
•	These elements can not be handled by the Web browser natively...
Even if differences exist between ids, classes and css/js implementations, they also share common behaviors, layouts, and "ways of doing things" that could be guessed at first glance by a human.
So various studies have been conducted in order to identify the most popular ids, class names, widgets, etc. used on the Web:
Quoting from this article: "During the creation of HTML5, Ian Hickson used Google's tools to mine data from over a billion Web pages, surveying what ids and class names are most commonly used on the real world Web. Opera did a similar study of 3.5 million URLs, calling it MAMA ("Metadata Analysis and Mining Application"). MAMA, as structural Web-paged search engine, had a smaller URL set, but looked at a larger and wider variety of Web page statistics".
New elements added to the HTML5 set
The results of these surveys led to the addition of new structural elements in HTML5. For example, the very popular <div class="header"> led to the creation of a <header> element, <div class="aside"> to a <aside> element, etc.
Finally, the 20 most popular ids and class names found in Hickson's and Opera's surveys gave birth to these new elements (click on the element's name to go to the W3C specification about this element):
HTML5 structural elements with descriptions.
HTML5 element	Description
<header>
Introduction of "sectioning elements": an article, a section, the entire document (header page). Typically the header of a Web site that appears on top of each page, or a header of a long <article> or of a long <section>
<footer>
Contains the footer of a site, a long <article>, or a long <section>
<nav>
Section that contains the main navigation links (within the document or to other pages).
<article>
Independent content, which can be individually extracted from the document and syndicated (RSS or equivalent) without penalizing its understanding. Typically a blog post.
<section>
Generic section used to group different articles for different purposes or subjects, or to define the different sections of a single article. Generally used with a header.
<time>
Used for marking up times and dates.
<aside>
Section whose content is not necessarily directly related to the main content that surrounds it, but can provide additional information.
<figure> and <figcaption>
Used to encapsulate a figure as a single item, and contains a caption for the figure, respectively.
<main>
The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application. There can be only one <main> element in a document.
And there is no <content> element even though the <div class="content"> was very popular. Instead, the HTML5 group decided that anything not embedded in one of the elements from the above table is "default content". If the content is of a type that corresponds to one of the elements from the table, i.e. if the content is an article, it should be embedded between <article> and </article>.
Read also at the end of this section about the new <main> element. This element is part of the HTML5 recommendation and  an integral part of the HTML document structure.

A blog example that uses the structural elements
Let's study an example we put on JsBin (all examples we have cooked up are available on the jsbin.com Web site and can be modified freely: you can save your own version using the "Bins/create milestone" menu, share your version with others in the forums, etc. Don't  hesitate to play with the source code, you will never break anything).
Use a <header> at the top of the blog
 
This is an example of one way to organize a blog. Here, we have designed the HTML page using a <header> element that contains the "Simple HTML5 blog" text that appears on top of the page.
HTML code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
      <head>
         <meta charset="utf-8"/>
         <title>Simple HTML5 blog</title>
      </head>
      <body>
         <header>
            <h1>Simple <span>HTML5</span> blog</h1>
         </header>
...
The CSS rules we used:
header {
    color: #007e99;
    font-size: 2.5em;
    padding: 20px 50px
}
header span {
    color: #722
}
Use a <nav> for the navigation menu just below the header
 
The navigation menu just below the header is a <nav> element. For the purpose of this example we haven't provided any value for the hyperlinks...
HTML code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8"/>
   <title>Simple HTML5 blog</title>
</head>
<body>
<header>
   <h1>Simple <span>HTML5</span> blog</h1>
</header>
<nav>
    <ul>
       <li><span>Blog</span></li>
       <li><a href="">About</a></li>
       <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
And here is the CSS we used in this example for the <nav> element:
nav {
    font-size: 1.5em;
    margin: 5px 0;
    padding: 20px 50px
}
nav li {
    display: inline;
    margin: 0 15px
}
nav li:first-child {
    margin-left: 0
}
* html nav ul {
    margin-left: -15px
}
nav span, nav a {
    padding: 3px 15px 4px
}
nav span {
    background: #722;
    color: #fff
}
A <section> for each month and an <article> for each post in the blog
Now, we have one big <section> element that contains a set of <article> elements…
 
HTML code:
<section>

   <article>
    ...
   </article>

   <article>
    ...
   </article>

   <article>
    ...
   </article>

</section>
And here is the CSS:
section {
   float: left;
   padding: 35px 0;
   position: relative;
   width: 70%
}
section article {
   margin: 0 50px 40px;
   padding: 25px 0 0;
   position: relative
}
section header {
   font-size: 1em;
   padding: 0;
}
section h2 {
   font-size: 2.3em;
}
Note that the H2, article, article header, etc. will be styled using these rules.
Add a <header> at the beginning of each <article>
 
Next, in each article in the section we have a header (to display the article title), paragraphs (article content), and so on.
Example for the first blog article:
<section>
   <article>
     <header>
         <h2><a href="">Information about this example</a></h2>
     </header>

     <p>Try to move the mouse on different elements. The structure will be
     highlighted and you will be able
     to see the different inclusions of elements one in each other. If you
     move the cursor to this sentence, it will be highlighted in dark grey,
     showing the presence of an &lt;article&gt; element, surrounded by a
     &lt;section&gt; element (light grey), etc. So we have some articles in
     a single section element. The page title at the top is a &lt;header&gt;

     element, while the tag cloud on the right is a &lt;aside&gt; element. The
     main menu on top (with Blog, About, Contact) is a &lt;nav&gt; element.</p>

     <figure>
         <img src="HTML5-tags.png"
             alt="Example of HTML5 structural tags" />
         <figcaption>
             Fig. 1 : an example of how new structural elements could
             be used. This page put a &lt;nav&gt; on top, and does not have
             headers and footer for each article, like in this figure,
             but it could... By the way this is a
             &lt;figcaption&gt; inside a &lt;figure&gt; element...
         </figcaption>
    </figure>

   </article>
   ...
</section>
Use <figure> and <figcaption> and embed <img> inside
Also note the way we included a figure using the new "HTML5" method, using a <figure>..</figure> element that embedded a <img src=.../> element together with a <figcaption> element. 
 
Here is the CSS for the <figcaption> element we have used in the example (we did not apply any style to the <figure> element):
HTML code:
1.	<figure>
2.	<img src="HTML5-tags.png"
a.	alt="Example of HTML5 structural tags" />
3.	<figcaption>
a.	Fig. 1 : an example of how .....
4.	</figcaption>
5.	</figure>
CSS code:
1.	figcaption {
2.	font-style:italic;
3.	font-size: 0.8em;
4.	width: 100%
5.	}
Use an <aside> element to display a tag cloud on the... side of the main content
After the long <section> element that contains all the blog articles displayed in the page, we added the HTML code for the tag cloud that is displayed on the right of the page, "aside"! This is done using - you already guessed it - an <aside> element:
 
<section>
.... all <article>... </article> here....
</section>
<aside>
   <h2>Tag cloud</h2>
   <ul class="tag-cloud">
       <li><a href="" rel="tag" class="w2">ajax</a></li>
       <li><a href="" rel="tag" class="w8">apple</a></li>
       <li><a href="" rel="tag" class="w3">css</a></li>
       ...
   </ul>
</aside>
...
We are not going to show the complete CSS here as it uses some tricks to display the list as a "real tag cloud" that uses JavaScript for handling events, etc. Those who are curious can look at the code of the online example.
Here is the CSS for the <aside> element:
aside {
    float: right;
    padding: 70px 0 30px;
    position: relative;
    width: 25%
}

aside h2 {
    color: #888;
    font-size: 1.8em
}
aside .tag-cloud {
    padding: 15px 35px 10px 0;
    text-align: center
}
...
We used a float:right CSS rule to put the tag cloud on the right... In the following section we will provide several examples that explain how to make a nice layout with the new structural elements, using simple CSS rules.
Here is the result:
 
Add a <footer> at the end of the blog
 
Finally, we added a <footer> element (lines 12-14 below) after the tag cloud definition, to display a page footer:
<html>
...
<body>
...
<section>
...
</section>
<aside>
...
</aside>

<footer>
   <p>&copy; 2009 Some blog</p>
</footer>

</body>
</html>
With this CSS rule:
footer {
    clear: both;
    color: #777;
    padding: 10px 50px
}
And here is the result at the bottom of the page:
 
More on <article> and <section>
Can an <article> contain a <section>?
 
It may not be clear whether a <section> may contain one or several <article> elements or if an <article> may contain one or several <section> elements.
The <article> element was designed for stand-alone parts of a document that could eventually be syndicated in RSS streams.
<section> elements are used to cut a logical part into subparts.
An <article> may be cut into different <section> elements!
Example of a blog post defined as a long <article>, that is in turn cut into smaller <section> elements:
<article id="id1">

   <section id="id1part1">
     <h2>Introduction</h2>
   </section>

   <section id="id1part2">
     <h2>My travel to India</h2>
   </section>

   <section id="id1part3">
     <h2>Return to France</h2>
   </section>

</article>
The blog example from the previous part of the course, on the other hand, uses a single <section> that contains several <article> elements.
Indeed, we can also have a <section> that regroups all blog posts per month, each one being an <article> element.
A <section> may be cut into different <article> elements, too!
Can you put a <nav> in an <article>?
Yes, you can, in case you would like to propose some navigation links with each blog post, for example:
<article>
   <header>
     <h1>Blog post title</h1>
       <p>Author: Michel</p>
   </header>
   <nav>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="...">Next post</a></li>
           <li><a href="...">Previous post</a></li>
           <li><a href="...">Contact author</a></li>
       </ul>
   </nav>
   <p>Content...</p>
   <footer>
     <p>Posted by Michel, the <time datetime="2012-02-02">February 2,

     2012</time> </p>
   </footer>
</article>
In that case, the <nav> element proposes navigation links to the next or previous blog post, as well as a link to contact the author of the blog post.
Also note that we used in that example a <footer> element in the blog post.
What about the <div> element? Is it still useful?
The new elements have been primarily designed to better structure the code of HTML pages such as those generated by blog or CMS software, however do not forget that they add new semantics and will be taken into account by:
•	Browsers natively or browsers' extensions, i.e. for automatically generating a table of contents, an outline view of the document, for applying default CSS rules to these elements, etc. See for example the table-of-contents-crx extension (Chrome extension). More on that in the next section of the course.
•	Text to speech: https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/speech/
•	Web crawlers, etc.
You can use <div> elements in all cases where the proposed structural elements do not fit your needs: for defining some content that should be styled, for example.
This chart from the HTML5 Doctor Web site may help you decide whether or not to use a <div>:
 
Headings & Structural Elements
We will now present some best practices for starting to use <section>, <article>, <nav>, <aside>, in particular concerning the use of headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6).
Use <h1>...<h6> for the headings
Since the very beginning, HTML has had heading elements: <h1>...<h6>. These elements are used to display headings with different sizes by default, when no CSS is used.  The following example shows 6 sentences that are surrounded by <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> and <h6>:
This is a H1 heading
This is a H2 heading
This is a H3 heading
This is a H4 heading
This is a H5 heading
This is a H6 heading
These headings define a hierarchy, as shown by the default sizes given by the browser. This hierarchy can also be used to define an outline of the document. To illustrate this, we have used a browser extension. Here is the result for the previous example:
 
In the above outline, note that we have only used H1... H6 elements, without any new HTML5 structural elements such as <section> or <article>.
Here is a list of browser extensions you can try, for visualizing the outline of a document: table-of-contents-crx Chrome extension or this Firefox extension.
Using headings and new sectioning elements (section, article, aside, nav)
Definition of heading content and sectioning content
The <section>, <article>, <nav> and <aside> elements are called "sectioning elements". They cut a document into slices we call "sections".
The HTML5 specification says that "each sectioning element potentially has a heading and has also an outline associated".
<h1>...<h6> are called headings, and define the header of a section (whether explicitly marked up using sectioning content elements, or implied by the heading content itself). This means that:
<body>
    <h1>Title of my document</h1>
    ...
</body>
... defines the header of a section implicitly, while:
<body>
   ...
   <section>
      <h1>Title of my section</h1>
      ...
   </section>
</body>
... defines the heading of the explicit section (its parent element <section>).
Use multiple headings of different rank with sectioning content
The first element of a heading content in an element of sectioning content represents the heading for that section (the <section><h1>...</h1></section> in the above example).
Subsequent headings of equal or higher rank start new (implied) sections, headings of lower rank start implied subsections that are part of the previous one. In both cases, the element represents the heading of the implied section.
Let's clarify this by looking at some example code:
<body>
<section>
    <h1>This H1 is the heading of an explicit section</h1>
    ...
       <h2>This H2 is a subheading, part of the same section
           (lower rank)</h2>
            ....
    <h1>This H1 starts an implicit new section in the explicit
        section (equal or higher rank)</h1>
        ...
        <h2>This is a H2 heading in the new section that has
            just started</h2>
            ...
</section>
</body>
The corresponding outline is:
 
 In the above example, please note two things:
1.	The outline shows an "Untitled body" at the root of the hierarchy,
2.	The default size for the H1 and H2 is the same (!). Indeed, when we start a <h1> inside a <section> the browser lowers its default size automatically, as if a new hierarchy level has been added artificially. We will discuss this further in the following sections, as we introduce some best practices.
Best Practices when using Sectioning Elements
Best practice #1: always add a heading to explicit sectioning content
It's always better - mainly for accessibility reasons - to include a heading (a <h1>, <h2>...<h6>) in each sectioning element (<section>, <article>, <nav>, <aside>), but also after the <body> element (called a "sectioning root"). 
Here are some examples:
Good (heading in each explicit section):
<section>
    <h1>Blog post of April 2020</h1>
    ...
</section>
Good (heading in a <header> does not change anything)
<section>
   <header>
      <h1>Blog post of April 2020</h1>
      <p>Posted by Michel Buffa...</p>
   </header>
...
</section>
Bad (there is no Hx after the <section> -> no heading):
<section>
   <header>
      <p class="article title">Blog post of April 2020</p>
      <p>Posted by Michel Buffa...</p>
   </header>
   ...
</section>
The last example is bad for accessibility reasons. A screen reader that vocalizes the page will just say "Entering section", while in the previous two good examples it would say "entering section with heading Blog Posts of April 2020". You can also check if your headings and sectioning elements are ok by using a browser extension that displays the outline of the document (just search for "html5 outliner" in your browser's extension search engine).
UPDATE : For the course screenshots, we used the Google Chrome HTML5 outliner extension that is no more available (it has been removed by its developer), but you can use any other equivalent extension such as table-of-contents-crx for Chrome or Outline sidebar for Firefox.
The outline of the last example looks like this:
 
Notice that <body> is also a sectioning element. It's called a "sectioning root", and would also need a heading.
Final good version:
<body>
    <h1>Example Blog</h1>
    <section>
       <header>
          <h2>Blog post of April 2020</h2>
          <p>Posted by Michel Buffa...</p>
       </header>
      <p>Content of the blog post...</p>
   </section>
</body>
In red, the sectioning root (<body>) and the sectioning elements (<section> here...), each have a heading.
To sum up:
•	Always use a heading element after a sectioning element, for example <section><Hx>...</Hx>...</section>, and after <body>, where x can be 1..6,
•	Or, use a <header> element, like in <section><header><Hx>...</Hx>.....</header>...</section>
More about the <header> element
The <header> element is just a container. It is not taken into account for defining new sections of a document nor does it affect the hierarchy levels. 
You can use heading elements <h1>...<h6> in a <header> but be careful if you use more than one, as the rules explained in the previous part of the course will apply and may generate implicit "sections" in the header.
This example has two headings in the <header>:
<section>
   <header>
     <h1>Some text in a h1 in a header of a section</h1>
     <h2>This a h2 in the header...</h2>
   </header>
</section>
Here is the resulting table of contents, notice the two subsections that appear, one for the H1, one for the H2:
 
Indeed, HTML does not have a dedicated mechanism for marking up subheadings, alternative titles or taglines. 
If you do not want the subtitles to be included in the table of contents, just use standard markup, for example <p> elements, as shown in the next example. Of course, CSS rules can be applied to change colors, sizes, etc.
<header>
    <h1>HTML 5.1 Nightly</h1>
    <p>A vocabulary and associated APIs for HTML and XHTML</p>
    <p>Editor's Draft 9 May 2013</p>
</header>
Best practice #2: try not to rely on implicit sectioning, use <section>, <article>, etc. instead of just <h1>...<h6>
The example below defines several implicit "sections" by using <Hx> directly (at lines 7 and 9):
Ok version (no explicit sections everywhere):
<body>
<h4>Apples</h4>
<p>Apples are fruit.</p>
<section>
     <h2>Taste</h2>
     <p>They taste lovely.</p>
     <h6>Sweet</h6>
     <p>Red apples are sweeter than green ones.</p>
     <h1>Color</h1>
     <p>Apples come in various colors.</p>
</section>
</body>
Better version (best practice):
<body>
<h1>Apples</h1>
<p>Apples are fruit.</p>
<section>
     <h2>Taste</h2>
     <p>They taste lovely.</p>
     <section>
         <h3>Sweet</h3>
         <p>Red apples are sweeter than green ones.</p>
     </section>
</section>
<section>
     <h2>Color</h2>
     <p>Apples come in various colors.</p>
</section>
</body>
Both of the examples above are semantically identical and produce the same outline:
 
1.2.4 The HTML5 Logo
Here is the HTML5 logo! It has been unveiled on 18 January 2011, so way before HTML5 became a Web standard. This logo represents HTML5, the cornerstone for modern Web applications.
 
1.3 Structural Elements
Changes have been made to particular elements in HTML5 making it simpler to use. In this section, we will look at some examples highlighting these improvements, including:
•	the new doctype definition;
•	the fact that the "type" attribute of elements such as <link> or <script> are now optional;
•	the syntax constraints that have been relaxed;
•	the new structural elements that have been added, etc.
A minimal HTML5 document
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <title>Page Title</title>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
... <!-- The rest is content -->
</body>
</html>
Let's compare it to the HTML4 minimal document below (taken from this source). Differences are underlined in red:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html" charset="utf-8">
    <title>title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
Simpler character set definition
One word about the <meta charset="utf-8"> at line 4 in the HTML5 version: it is a best practice to declare the character set of your document to protect against a serious security risk. For more details, please refer to the "Why Internationalization is important" section in the Course intro chapter.
No more complicated DOCTYPE definitions
The "DOCTYPE" (Document Type Declaration) is used by tools such as HTML validators (i.e.  the W3C validator), and specifies the rules used by  an HTML or an XHTML page. These rules are contained in special documents called "Document Type Definitions" (also abbreviated as DTDs), written in a language that may seem a bit barbaric to humans (they are intended to be read by software), and hosted by W3C.
DTDs are not used by current Web browsers to  validate the structure of an HTML page, as  they "read" the code without using the DTD to decipher it, using only "rules" contained in their own "HTML engine", but it is still preferable to indicate the doctype as modern browsers have several rendering engines that are chosen depending on the doctype.
Old HTML1 Web pages will not be rendered the same way as new HTML5 pages, since, in the 90's, some of them were written by hand and may contain errors, embedded HTML elements, etc.
With HTML4, doctype definitions looked like this: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">, which was even more complicated as one had to choose between three different possibilities (doctypes could be transitional, strict, or frameset). Most of the time, the doctype definition was copied and pasted from one document to another and was nearly impossible to memorize.
With HTML5, there is only one way to indicate the doctype, and it's so simple there is no reason to forget it:
1.	<!doctype html>
The "TYPE" attribute is optional
With a rel="stylesheet" attribute, it is no longer necessary to indicate type="text/css" (from the specification: "the default type for resources given by the  stylesheet  keyword is text/css.")
The "type" attribute is not needed in HTML5, and even old browsers will use text/css as the default type for stylesheets today. So, either way, you can omit the "type" attribute altogether and use:
1.	<link href="file.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
instead of:
1.	<link href="file.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
We will not go into detail about the <link> element, but the fact that the type attribute is becoming optional shows the current direction taken by HTML5: towards greater simplicity.
Please see how to include a JavaScript file in our page:
1.	<script src="script.js"></script>
Here again, the type attribute has been omitted. Just as a reminder, the old way to do the same thing is: 
1.	<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
More flexible syntax constraints
If you look at the "minimal document" example, or at other examples in this course, you won't find a lot of differences compared to the same code in XHTML: attribute values are surrounded by quotes, all elements are written in lower case, etc. This is because we are used to writing this way, but HTML5 also supports a simplified syntax:
•	Thanks to HTML5, you can omit quotes (not always, but most of the time) or use uppercase, lowercase or a combination of the two.
•	Many elements no longer need a closing tag: </li>, </dt>, </dd>, </tr>, </th>, </td>, </thead>, </tfoot>, </tbody>, </option>, </optgroup>, </p> (in most cases), </head>, </body> and </html>. Older browsers often add closing tags automatically at render time. We recommend, however, closing tags that would naturally be closed: the ones that delimit a particular zone in the document.
•	Attribute values only need to be quoted if they contain spaces or some non-alphanumeric characters, instead of writing <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">, we could have used <link rel=stylesheet href=style.css>. However, for compatibility with older browsers, it is wiser to still use quotes...
 
1.3.2 Structural Elements
New structural elements
 
History
As Web site layouts evolve, HTML5 structural elements such as lists, paragraphs, tables, etc. show their limits. Today, many Web sites offer navigation menus, tabbed panels, headers, footers, and so on. The way these "parts"' are implemented relies heavily on <div> and <span> elements with different id and class attributes, lots of CSS and lots of JavaScript code to apply custom styles and behaviors.
However, there are some issues with this approach:
•	id and class names differ from one developer to another, from one country to another, etc.
•	Even with the same ids and class names, the css rules may be different
•	JavaScript libraries have become increasingly heavy over the years
•	Web pages have become increasingly heavy over the years!
•	These elements can not be handled by the Web browser natively...
Even if differences exist between ids, classes and css/js implementations, they also share common behaviors, layouts, and "ways of doing things" that could be guessed at first glance by a human.
So various studies have been conducted in order to identify the most popular ids, class names, widgets, etc. used on the Web:
Quoting from this article: "During the creation of HTML5, Ian Hickson used Google's tools to mine data from over a billion Web pages, surveying what ids and class names are most commonly used on the real world Web. Opera did a similar study of 3.5 million URLs, calling it MAMA ("Metadata Analysis and Mining Application"). MAMA, as structural Web-paged search engine, had a smaller URL set, but looked at a larger and wider variety of Web page statistics".
New elements added to the HTML5 set
The results of these surveys led to the addition of new structural elements in HTML5. For example, the very popular <div class="header"> led to the creation of a <header> element, <div class="aside"> to a <aside> element, etc.
Finally, the 20 most popular ids and class names found in Hickson's and Opera's surveys gave birth to these new elements (click on the element's name to go to the W3C specification about this element):
HTML5 structural elements with descriptions.
HTML5 element	Description
<header>
Introduction of "sectioning elements": an article, a section, the entire document (header page). Typically the header of a Web site that appears on top of each page, or a header of a long <article> or of a long <section>
<footer>
Contains the footer of a site, a long <article>, or a long <section>
<nav>
Section that contains the main navigation links (within the document or to other pages).
<article>
Independent content, which can be individually extracted from the document and syndicated (RSS or equivalent) without penalizing its understanding. Typically a blog post.
<section>
Generic section used to group different articles for different purposes or subjects, or to define the different sections of a single article. Generally used with a header.
<time>
Used for marking up times and dates.
<aside>
Section whose content is not necessarily directly related to the main content that surrounds it, but can provide additional information.
<figure> and <figcaption>
Used to encapsulate a figure as a single item, and contains a caption for the figure, respectively.
<main>
The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application. There can be only one <main> element in a document.
And there is no <content> element even though the <div class="content"> was very popular. Instead, the HTML5 group decided that anything not embedded in one of the elements from the above table is "default content". If the content is of a type that corresponds to one of the elements from the table, i.e. if the content is an article, it should be embedded between <article> and </article>.
Read also at the end of this section about the new <main> element .  This element is part of the HTML5 recommendation and  an integral part of the HTML document structure.

1.3.3 Mixing All Elements Together: A Blog Example
A blog example that uses the structural elements
Let's study an example we put on JsBin (all examples we have cooked up are available on the jsbin.com Web site and can be modified freely: you can save your own version using the "Bins/create milestone" menu, share your version with others in the forums, etc. Don't  hesitate to play with the source code, you will never break anything).
Use a <header> at the top of the blog
 
This is an example of one way to organize a blog. Here, we have designed the HTML page using a <header> element that contains the "Simple HTML5 blog" text that appears on top of the page.
HTML code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
      <head>
         <meta charset="utf-8"/>
         <title>Simple HTML5 blog</title>
      </head>
      <body>
         <header>
            <h1>Simple <span>HTML5</span> blog</h1>
         </header>
...
The CSS rules we used:
header {
    color: #007e99;
    font-size: 2.5em;
    padding: 20px 50px
}
header span {
    color: #722
}
Use a <nav> for the navigation menu just below the header
 
The navigation menu just below the header is a <nav> element. For the purpose of this example we haven't provided any value for the hyperlinks...
HTML code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8"/>
   <title>Simple HTML5 blog</title>
</head>
<body>
<header>
   <h1>Simple <span>HTML5</span> blog</h1>
</header>
<nav>
    <ul>
       <li><span>Blog</span></li>
       <li><a href="">About</a></li>
       <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
And here is the CSS we used in this example for the <nav> element:
nav {
    font-size: 1.5em;
    margin: 5px 0;
    padding: 20px 50px
}
nav li {
    display: inline;
    margin: 0 15px
}
nav li:first-child {
    margin-left: 0
}
* html nav ul {
    margin-left: -15px
}
nav span, nav a {
    padding: 3px 15px 4px
}
nav span {
    background: #722;
    color: #fff
}
A <section> for each month and an <article> for each post in the blog
Now, we have one big <section> element that contains a set of <article> elements...
 
HTML code:
<section>

   <article>
    ...
   </article>

   <article>
    ...
   </article>

   <article>
    ...
   </article>

</section>
And here is the CSS:
section {
   float: left;
   padding: 35px 0;
   position: relative;
   width: 70%
}
section article {
   margin: 0 50px 40px;
   padding: 25px 0 0;
   position: relative
}
section header {
   font-size: 1em;
   padding: 0;
}
section h2 {
   font-size: 2.3em;
}
Note that the H2, article, article header, etc. will be styled using these rules.
Add a <header> at the beginning of each <article>
 
Next, in each article in the section we have a header (to display the article title), paragraphs (article content), and so on.
Example for the first blog article:
<section>
   <article>
     <header>
         <h2><a href="">Information about this example</a></h2>
     </header>

     <p>Try to move the mouse on different elements. The structure will be
     highlighted and you will be able
     to see the different inclusions of elements one in each other. If you
     move the cursor to this sentence, it will be highlighted in dark grey,
     showing the presence of an &lt;article&gt; element, surrounded by a
     &lt;section&gt; element (light grey), etc. So we have some articles in
     a single section element. The page title at the top is a &lt;header&gt;

     element, while the tag cloud on the right is a &lt;aside&gt; element. The
     main menu on top (with Blog, About, Contact) is a &lt;nav&gt; element.</p>

     <figure>
         <img src="HTML5-tags.png"
             alt="Example of HTML5 structural tags" />
         <figcaption>
             Fig. 1 : an example of how new structural elements could
             be used. This page put a &lt;nav&gt; on top, and does not have
             headers and footer for each article, like in this figure,
             but it could... By the way this is a
             &lt;figcaption&gt; inside a &lt;figure&gt; element...
         </figcaption>
    </figure>

   </article>
   ...
</section>
Use <figure> and <figcaption> and embed <img> inside
Also note the way we included a figure using the new "HTML5" method, using a <figure>..</figure> element that embedded a <img src=.../> element together with a <figcaption> element. 
 
Here is the CSS for the <figcaption> element we have used in the example (we did not apply any style to the <figure> element):
HTML code:
<figure>
    <img src="HTML5-tags.png"
         alt="Example of HTML5 structural tags" />
    <figcaption>
        Fig. 1 : an example of how .....
    </figcaption>
</figure>
CSS code:
figcaption {
    font-style:italic;
    font-size: 0.8em;
    width: 100%
}
Use an <aside> element to display a tag cloud on the... side of the main content
After the long <section> element that contains all the blog articles displayed in the page, we added the HTML code for the tag cloud that is displayed on the right of the page, "aside"! This is done using - you already guessed it - an <aside> element:
 
<section>
.... all <article>... </article> here....
</section>
<aside>
   <h2>Tag cloud</h2>
   <ul class="tag-cloud">
       <li><a href="" rel="tag" class="w2">ajax</a></li>
       <li><a href="" rel="tag" class="w8">apple</a></li>
       <li><a href="" rel="tag" class="w3">css</a></li>
       ...
   </ul>
</aside>
...
We are not going to show the complete CSS here as it uses some tricks to display the list as a "real tag cloud" that uses JavaScript for handling events, etc. Those who are curious can look at the code of the online example.
Here is the CSS for the <aside> element:
aside {
    float: right;
    padding: 70px 0 30px;
    position: relative;
    width: 25%
}

aside h2 {
    color: #888;
    font-size: 1.8em
}
aside .tag-cloud {
    padding: 15px 35px 10px 0;
    text-align: center
}
...
We used a float:right CSS rule to put the tag cloud on the right... In a following section we will provide several examples that explain how to make a nice layout with the new structural elements, using simple CSS rules.
Here is the result:
 
Add a <footer> at the end of the blog
 
Finally, we added a <footer> element (lines 12-14 below) after the tag cloud definition, to display a page footer:
<html>
...
<body>
...
<section>
...
</section>
<aside>
...
</aside>

<footer>
   <p>&copy; 2009 Some blog</p>
</footer>

</body>
</html>
With this CSS rule:
footer {
    clear: both;
    color: #777;
    padding: 10px 50px
}
And here is the result at the bottom of the page:
 
1.3.4 More on <article> and <section>
Can an <article> contain a <section>?
 
It may not be clear whether a <section> may contain one or several  <article> elements or if an <article> may contain one or several <section> elements.
•	The <article> element was designed for stand-alone parts of a document that could eventually be syndicated in RSS streams.
•	<section> elements are used to cut a logical part into subparts.
An <article> may be cut into different <section> elements!
Example of a blog post defined as a long <article>, that is in turn cut into smaller <section> elements:
<article id="id1">

   <section id="id1part1">
     <h2>Introduction</h2>
   </section>

   <section id="id1part2">
     <h2>My travel to India</h2>
   </section>

   <section id="id1part3">
     <h2>Return to France</h2>
   </section>

</article>
The blog example from the previous part of the course, on the other hand, uses a single <section> that contains several <article> elements.
Indeed, we can also have a <section> that regroups all blog posts per month, each one being an <article> element.
A <section> may be cut into different <article> elements, too!
Can you put a <nav> in an <article>?
Yes, you can, in case you would like to propose some navigation links with each blog post, for example:
<article>
   <header>
     <h1>Blog post title</h1>
       <p>Author: Michel</p>
   </header>
   <nav>
       <ul>
           <li><a href="...">Next post</a></li>
           <li><a href="...">Previous post</a></li>
           <li><a href="...">Contact author</a></li>
       </ul>
   </nav>
   <p>Content...</p>
   <footer>
     <p>Posted by Michel, the <time datetime="2012-02-02">February 2,

     2012</time> </p>
   </footer>
</article>
In that case, the <nav> element proposes navigation links to the next or previous blog post, as well as a link to contact the author of the blog post.
Also note that we used in that example a <footer> element in the blog post.
What about the <div> element? Is it still useful?
The new elements have been primarily designed to better structure the code of HTML pages such as those generated by blog or CMS software, however do not forget that they add new semantics and will be taken into account by :
•	Browsers natively or browsers' extensions, i.e. for automatically generating a table of contents, an outline view of the document, for applying default CSS rules to these elements, etc. See for example the table-of-contents-crx extension (Chrome extension). More on that in the next section of the course.
•	Text to speech: https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/speech/
•	Web crawlers, etc.
You can use <div> elements in all cases where the proposed structural elements do not fit your needs: for defining some content that should be styled, for example.
This chart from the HTML5 Doctor Web site may help you decide whether or not to use a <div>:
 
1.3.5 Headings and Structural Elements
We will now present some best practices for starting to use <section>, <article>, <nav>, <aside>, in particular concerning the use of headings (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6).
Use <h1>...<h6> for the headings
Since the very beginning, HTML has had heading elements: <h1>...<h6>. These elements are used to display headings with different sizes by default, when no CSS is used.  The following example shows 6 sentences that are surrounded by <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> and <h6>:
This is a H1 heading
This is a H2 heading
This is a H3 heading
This is a H4 heading
This is a H5 heading
This is a H6 heading
These headings define a hierarchy, as shown by the default sizes given by the browser. This hierarchy can also be used to define an outline of the document. To illustrate this, we have used a browser extension. Here is the result for the previous example:
 
In the above outline, note that we have only used H1... H6 elements, without any new HTML5 structural elements such as <section> or <article>.
Here is a list of browser extensions you can try, for visualizing the outline of a document: table-of-contents-crx Chrome extension or this Firefox extension.
Using headings and new sectioning elements (section, article, aside, nav)
Definition of heading content and sectioning content
The <section>, <article>, <nav> and <aside> elements are called "sectioning elements". They cut a document into slices we call "sections".
The HTML5 specification says that "each sectioning element potentially has a heading and has also an outline associated".
<h1>...<h6> are called headings, and define the header of a section (whether explicitly marked up using sectioning content elements, or implied by the heading content itself). This means that:
<body>
    <h1>Title of my document</h1>
    ...
</body>
... defines the header of a section implicitly, while:
<body>
   ...
   <section>
      <h1>Title of my section</h1>
      ...
   </section>
</body>
... defines the heading of the explicit section (its parent element <section>).
Use multiple headings of different rank with sectioning content
The first element of a heading content in an element of sectioning content represents the heading for that section (the <section><h1>...</h1></section> in the above example).
Subsequent headings of equal or higher rank start new (implied) sections, headings of lower rank start implied subsections that are part of the previous one. In both cases, the element represents the heading of the implied section.
Let's clarify this by looking at some example code:
<body>
<section>
    <h1>This H1 is the heading of an explicit section</h1>
    ...
       <h2>This H2 is a subheading, part of the same section
           (lower rank)</h2>
            ....
    <h1>This H1 starts an implicit new section in the explicit
        section (equal or higher rank)</h1>
        ...
        <h2>This is a H2 heading in the new section that has
            just started</h2>
            ...
</section>
</body>
The corresponding outline is:
 
In the above example, please note two things:
1.	The outline shows an "Untitled body" at the root of the hierarchy,
2.	The default size for the H1 and H2 is the same (!). Indeed, when we start a <h1> inside a <section> the browser lowers its default size automatically, as if a new hierarchy level has been added artificially. We will discuss this further in the following sections, as we introduce some best practices.
1.3.6 Best Practices When Using Sectioning Elements
Best practice #1: always add a heading to explicit sectioning content
It's always better - mainly for accessibility reasons - to include a heading (a <h1>, <h2>...<h6>) in each sectioning element (<section>, <article>, <nav>, <aside>), but also after the <body> element (called a "sectioning root"). 
Here are some examples:
Good (heading in each explicit section):
<section>
    <h1>Blog post of April 2020</h1>
    ...
</section>
Good (heading  in a <header> does not change anything)
<section>
   <header>
      <h1>Blog post of April 2020</h1>
      <p>Posted by Michel Buffa...</p>
   </header>
...
</section>
Bad (there is no Hx after the <section> -> no heading):
<section>
   <header>
      <p class="article title">Blog post of April 2020</p>
      <p>Posted by Michel Buffa...</p>
   </header>
   ...
</section>
The last example is bad for accessibility reasons. A screen reader that vocalizes the page will just say "Entering section", while in the previous two good examples it would say "entering section with heading Blog Posts of April 2020". You can also check if your headings and sectioning elements are ok by using a browser extension that displays the outline of the document (just search for "html5 outliner" in your browser's extension search engine).
UPDATE : For the course screenshots, we used the Google Chrome HTML5 outliner extension that is no more available (it has been removed by its developer), but you can use any other equivalent extension such as table-of-contents-crx for Chrome or Outline sidebar for Firefox.
The outline of the last example looks like this:
 
Notice that <body> is also a sectioning element. It's called a "sectioning root", and would also need a heading.
Final good version:
<body>
    <h1>Example Blog</h1>
    <section>
       <header>
          <h2>Blog post of April 2020</h2>
          <p>Posted by Michel Buffa...</p>
       </header>
      <p>Content of the blog post...</p>
   </section>
</body>
In red, the sectioning root (<body>) and the sectioning elements (<section> here...), each have a heading.
To sum up:
o	Always use a heading element after a sectioning element, for example <section><Hx>...</Hx>...</section>, and after <body>, where x can be 1..6,
o	Or, use a <header> element, like in <section><header><Hx>...</Hx>.....</header>...</section>
More about the <header> element
The <header> element is just a container. It is not taken into account for defining new sections of a document nor does it affect the hierarchy levels. 
You can use heading elements <h1>...<h6> in a <header> but be careful if you use more than one, as the rules explained in the previous part of the course will apply and may generate implicit "sections" in the header.
This example has two headings in the <header>:
1.	<section>
2.	   <header>
3.	     <h1>Some text in a h1 in a header of a section</h1>
4.	     <h2>This a h2 in the header...</h2>
5.	   </header>
6.	</section>
Here is the resulting table of contents, notice the two subsections that appear, one for the H1, one for the H2:
 
Indeed, HTML does not have a dedicated mechanism for marking up subheadings, alternative titles or taglines. 
If you do not want the subtitles to be included in the table of contents, just use standard markup, for example <p> elements, as shown in the next example. Of course, CSS rules can be applied to change colors, sizes, etc.
1.	<header>
2.	    <h1>HTML 5.1 Nightly</h1>
3.	    <p>A vocabulary and associated APIs for HTML and XHTML</p>
4.	    <p>Editor's Draft 9 May 2013</p>
5.	</header>
Best practice #2: try not to rely on implicit sectioning, use <section>, <article>, etc. instead of just <h1>...<h6>
The example below defines several implicit "sections" by using <Hx> directly (at lines 7 and 9):
Ok version (no explicit sections everywhere):
1.	<body>
2.	<h4>Apples</h4>
3.	<p>Apples are fruit.</p>
4.	<section>
5.	     <h2>Taste</h2>
6.	     <p>They taste lovely.</p>
7.	     <h6>Sweet</h6>
8.	     <p>Red apples are sweeter than green ones.</p>
9.	     <h1>Color</h1>
10.	     <p>Apples come in various colors.</p>
11.	</section>
12.	</body>
Better version (best practice):
1.	<body>
2.	<h1>Apples</h1>
3.	<p>Apples are fruit.</p>
4.	<section>
5.	     <h2>Taste</h2>
6.	     <p>They taste lovely.</p>
7.	     <section>
8.	         <h3>Sweet</h3>
9.	         <p>Red apples are sweeter than green ones.</p>
10.	     </section>
11.	</section>
12.	<section>
13.	     <h2>Color</h2>
14.	     <p>Apples come in various colors.</p>
15.	</section>
16.	</body>
Both of the examples above are semantically identical and produce the same outline:
 
1.3.7 Embedding a Table of Contents
Here we propose a small piece of JavaScript code you can use in your documents to display an embedded table of contents. 
This example is a simple document, with a hyperlink that, once clicked, displays the table of contents in an <aside> element in the main <section>. Just look at the source code and copy/paste the link into your own HTML documents.
Online example at JsBin.
Extract of source code:
1.	<body>
2.	<h1>This is an example of embedded table of content</h1>
3.	<section>
4.	     <header>
5.	         <h1>First section of the document (this is a h1)</h1>
6.	         This is a subheading...
7.	     </header>
8.	     <h2>First subsection of the first section (a h2)</h2>
9.	     <p>Blah Blah...</p>
10.	 </section>
11.	<section>
12.	     <h1>Second section of the document (a h1)</h1>
13.	     <h2>First subsection (a h2)</h2>
14.	</section>
15.	<aside>
16.	     <h3>Table of contents</h3>
17.	     <a href="javascript:(function(){...})();"
18.	        title="TableDeMatiere">
19.	        Click here to display the table of contents!
20.	     </a>
21.	</aside>
22.	</body>
Best practice: visualizing the table of contents is useful for debugging the structure of your page, and checking the presence of headings after sectioning content.
Indeed, tools that generate the table of contents are a good way to debug the structure of your page. Is the hierarchy correct? Is it what I wanted when I designed my page?
They are also useful for checking the presence of headings in each sectioning content. If some headings are missing, the table of contents will display some "untitled entries". Remember that having a heading after each sectioning content is a good practice in terms of accessibility.
1.3.8 The <main> Element
 
If you use <nav> / <header> / <footer> etc. to structure your document, you can also use <main> to identify the main content of the document. Doing so provides a navigable document structure for assistive technology users as well as styling hooks for devs.
We have seen the different sectioning elements of HTML5, so why didn't we talk about the <main> element earlier in this part of the course? Shouldn't  <main>...</main> be used in place of  <div class="main">...</div>?
The <main> element is supported by major modern browsers (see the corresponding support table on CanIUse and MDN's brower compatibility page).
This element is subject to some constraints:
•	There must not be more than one <main> element in a document,
•	It must not be a descendant of an <article>,<aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav> element.
And finally, here are some examples (from the HTML5 specification)  that mix the <main> element with the other sectioning elements already seen in the course:
1.	<!-- other content -->
2.	
3.	<main>
4.	
5.	   <h1>Skateboards</h1>
6.	   <p>The skateboard helps kids to get around.</p>
7.	
8.	   <article>
9.	      <h2>Longboards</h2>
10.	      <p>Longboards are a type of skateboard with a longer
11.	wheelbase and larger, softer wheels.</p>
12.	      <p>... </p>
13.	      <p>... </p>
14.	   </article>
15.	
16.	   <article>
17.	      <h2>Electric Skateboards</h2>
18.	      <p>These no longer require the propelling of the skateboard by means of the feet; rather an electric motor propels the board, fed by an electric battery.</p>
19.	      <p>... </p>
20.	      <p>... </p>
21.	   </article>
22.	
23.	</main>
24.	 
25.	<!-- other content -->
Here is another example (also from the specification). Here the <main> element contains a <nav> element consisting of links to subsections of the main content:
1.	<!DOCTYPE html>
2.	   <html lang="en">
3.	      <head>
4.	         <meta charset="utf-8"/>
5.	         <title>Graduation Ceremony Summer 2022</title>
6.	      </head>
7.	      <body>
8.	       <header>The Lawson Academy:
9.	         <nav>
10.	            <h2>Click these links to navigate...</h2>
11.	            <ul>
12.	               <li><a href="courses.html">Courses</a></li>

14.	               <li><a>Graduation</a></li>
15.	            </ul>
16.	         </nav>
17.	      </header>
18.	      <main>
19.	         <h1>Graduation</h1>
20.	         <nav>
21.	            <h2>Please choose:</h2>

Best practice
For accessibility matters, a best practice is to split your page content into "regions" defined by the five 5 elements (aside, footer, header, main and nav) learned this week. 
We recommend this article written by Steve Faulkner: "Easy content organisation with HTML5" (24 September 2015). Steve explains in details how to organize an HTML document into "regions" based on the semantic markup elements we have seen so far during Module 1 of this course.
External resources:
•	This document has been written by the W3C HTML5 Working Group, which details the different use-cases for this element
•	Rationale and use cases for standardizing a 'main content' HTML feature
•	On MDN's Web Docs: the main element
1.3.9 The Blog Example, Applying Best Practices
Let's go back to our blog example and see what can be improved:
o	Do we have a heading after each sectioning element?
o	Did we use sectioning elements or implicit sections?
o	Can we embed a table of contents?
The blog example is online at JsBin:  let's see below what the Google Chrome HTML5 Outliner extension showed.
 
Also note that in this example, we used H1s after each sectioning element, and we still get a hierarchy, some H1s are inside an <article> that is in a <section> (this corresponds to the third example given in the "heading and sectioning elements" part of the course):
1.	<section>
2.	   <header>
3.	     <h1>Blog posts for April 2012</h1>
4.	   </header>
5.	   <article>
6.	     <header>
7.	       <h1><a href="">Information about this example</a></h1>
8.	       This example is a modified version of <a href="https://example.com/blog/index.html">https://example.com/blog/index.html</a>
9.	     </header>
10.	     ...
11.	   </article>
12.	</section>
With this technique, parts of the document can be moved more easily, or integrated inside an RSS stream, without the need to renumber the headings.
Beware that this technique will require you to use some CSS styling, and may confuse some screen readers that do not yet take into account this way of computing the heading hierarchy. A simple fix is to use an H1 right after the <body> and use only H2...H6 inside <section>, <article>, <nav> and <aside>.
Let's fix the missing heading
We need to add a heading in the <nav> element. This will both fix the outline of the document by removing the untitled entry, and will also make screen readers happy as they will better vocalize the structure of the page (it will say "entering nav" followed by the vocalization of the heading content).
1.	<nav>
2.	   <header>
3.	     <h1>Navigation menu</h1>
4.	   </header>
5.	   <ul>
6.	     <li><span>Blog</span></li>
7.	     <li><a href="">About</a></li>
8.	     <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
9.	   </ul>
10.	</nav>
Here is the fixed result:
 
A common remark from Web designers is: "we do not want a heading content displayed systematically after a <nav>, or an <aside> element..."
BEST PRACTICE #1: In order to NOT display the heading content on screen  the recommended technique  is described in this article by Steve Faulkner. Do not use display:none or visibility:hidden in your CSS stylesheet, as in that case the heading content will never be vocalized by screen readers, and more generally by assistive technologies. 

As an illustration of the recommended technique, see this JSBin version of the blog example that hides the <h2>Navigation menu</h2> from the <nav>...</nav> element, using the CSS technique explained in the above link.
BEST PRACTICE #2: it is not advised to include interactive content (links, controls etc) that is hidden offscreen (it is in fact a violation of the W3C WCAG 2.0 Guidelines). All interactive content must have a visible focus indicator (and be on screen when focused).
Embedding a table of contents and adding a <main> element
In the previous section, we saw how to embed a table of contents using some JavaScript code borrowed from the Google Chrome HTML5 outliner extension.
Let's add this piece of code (we removed the JS details from this extract):
1.	<aside>
2.	   <h1>
3.	     <a href="javascript:(function(){...});"
4.	        title="TableOfContents">
5.	        Click here to display the table of contents!
6.	     </a>
7.	   </h1>
8.	</aside>
We also added a <main> element to identify the main content of the page composed of the big section with all blog posts:
1.	<main>
2.	  <section>
3.	     <header>
4.	         <h2>Blog posts for April 2012</h2>
5.	     </header>
6.	     ...
7.	</main>
Use H1 as top level headings only, use H2...H6 in sectioning content
As explained in the article HTML5 Document Outline and in the W3C HTML Wiki , it is risky to use nested H1s, as browsers do not correctly implement the "outline algorithm".
The blog example uses nested H1’s. If you check it with the W3C conformance checker, it issues a warning: "Consider using the h1 element as a top-level heading only (all h1 elements are treated as top-level headings by many screen readers and other tools)."
While this is just a warning, we do prefer to use H1s only as top level elements, and replace the H1s we had after <section>, <article>, <nav> and <aside> elements respectively by a H2s and H3s. 
Extract from source code:
1.	<nav>
2.	   <header>
3.	     <h2>Navigation menu</h2>
4.	   </header>
5.	   ...
6.	</nav>

1.3.10 Examples of Page Layouts
In this section, we show some "classic" CSS layout techniques for designing an HTML page that uses the new sectioning elements. 
We embed examples from this very good post about "Positioning content". This is a recommended reading as it details how to use the CSS float property to layout a Web page.
The 4 examples below are given "as is" to give you some hints. There are lots of other possibilities on using CSS to position element.
Example #1: a <section> on the left and an <aside> on the right, using the float and width CSS properties
This example uses the following HTML structure (notice that we use the "HTML entity syntax" for displaying "<" or ">". For example, &lt; displays a "<" character).
1.	<header>
2.	<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>
3.	</header>
4.	 
5.	<section>
6.	<code>&lt;section&gt; <br> float: left;</code>
7.	</section>
8.	 
9.	<aside>
10.	<code>&lt;aside&gt; <br> float: right;</code>
11.	</aside>
12.	 
13.	<footer>
14.	<code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>
15.	</footer>
Here we use the CSS rule float:left for the <section> and the CSS rule float:right for the <aside>. When an element floats, it goes out of the normal flow of the HTML element. Then by default it floats to the edge of its parent; and its size depends on the elements it contains. So, in order to fill the whole horizontal space, we prefer here to "force the width" by setting the CSS width property with a percentage.  So we took width: 63% for the <section> on the left and width:30% for the <aside> on the right.
You can look at the complete CSS code in the interactive example below (click on the CSS or HTML text in the menu bar below, or click "edit on codepen" to change the code and see the results):
 
Also available online at JSBin.
 
Example #2: three sections centered, of equal size, also using the float and width CSS properties
Here we show how to make a 3 column layout using the CSS float property.
HTML code:
1.	<header>
2.	<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>
3.	</header>
4.	 
5.	<section>
6.	<code>&lt;section&gt; <br> float: left;</code>
7.	</section>
8.	 
9.	<section>
10.	<code>&lt;section&gt; <br> float: left;</code>
11.	</section>
12.	 
13.	<section>
14.	<code>&lt;section&gt; <br> float: left;</code>
15.	</section>
16.	 
17.	<footer>
18.	<code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>
19.	</footer>
Instead of having one element with a float:left and one element with a float:right property, we instead use float:left for all three of them, and we give a  width:30% CSS property value to each <section>. We also set a small margin so that the colums have a gap between them.
Look at the CSS code in the example below:
 
Example #3: same result using the CSS flex property
This example uses the CSS flex property to achieve a result similar to the one shown in Example 2.
There are many articles on Flexbox and we recommend those from Rachel Andrew on Smashing Magazine: "Use cases for Flexbox", "Flexbox: how big is that flexible box", etc.
 
Example #4: another example written by a student, that uses the flex property
This example also uses all the structuring elements we saw: main, article, section, etc. It uses only the simplest parts of the FlexBox CSS module, so it should be easy to understand, even for CSS beginners:

1.4.1 The <details> and <summary> Elements
These elements have been introduced for displaying a foldable zone in an HTML document.
In the screenshot below, taken from the W3C specification page, the text next to the horizontal arrow is a <summary> element, and the text displayed when we click on the summary part, is the <details> element. This is a sort of "accordion" with foldable content.
 
The <details> element generates a simple widget to show/hide element contents, optionally by clicking on its child <summary> element.
Here is an example of what can be done using these elements ) see the online version on JSBin:
 
And here is what is displayed after clicking on the small arrow-shaped icon to the left of the summary:
 
Here is the code of this example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"> ...

<body>
<details>
<summary>
How to beat the boss...spoiler alert !
</summary>
<p> Just aim to the red spots near his eyes</p>
<p>Keep shooting at these spots until the eyes open, then hit quickly both eyes with your laser beam.</p>
</details>
</body>
</html>
The <summary>...</summary> is inside a <details>...</details> element. By clicking on the icon at the left of the summary, the content of the <details> value is displayed/hidden.
<details> blocks can be embedded inside one another, like in this example:
Step 1: all folded:
 
Step 2: click on top level summary icon, the first "hidden" part appears...
 
Step3: click on embedded summary icon inside the part that has been previously unfolded
 
Source code of this example, see the summary/details inside another one:
<details>
<summary>
How to beat the boss...spoiler alert !
</summary>
<p> Just aim to the red spots near his eyes</p>
<p>Keep shooting at these spots until the eyes open, then hit quickly both eyes with your laser beam.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Bonus and spoiler No 2: get a new weapon by cutting the tail of the boss.
</summary>
<p>Before finishing him, try to cut his trail, you will get a new weapon</p>
<p>Just try to stay behind him as long as you can, hitting his tail with your melee weapon, after a few hits the trail will fall and you will get a new bonus weapon, then finish the boss.</p>
</details>
</details>
CSS pseudo classes for styling summary icons
There are CSS pseudo classes to style this icon when it is in the open or closed state. Support for these is still incomplete as of June 2020 (works on Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, not in FF).
Example1 (see online example):
 
The color and background of the icon on the left are specified by the following CSS rule, which uses the pseudo class ::-webkit-details-marker
In this example: red arrow, white background.
1.	summary::-webkit-details-marker {
2.	color:#FF0000;
3.	background:#FFFFFF;
4.	}
 
Once opened, the selector details[open] can style the icon when <details> is unfolded. In this example: blue arrow, turquoise background. Here is the corresponding CSS rule:
1.	details[open] summary::-webkit-details-marker {
2.	color:#0000FF;
3.	background:#00FFFF;
4.	}
It is also possible to change the icon itself using the CSS pseudo class :after
Example 2 (see it online):
 
 
CSS rules used in this example:
Use a "+" shaped icon, pink, bold, etc... :
1.	summary:after {
2.	content: "+";
3.	color: #FF00FF;
4.	float: left;
5.	font-size: 1.5em;
6.	font-weight: bold;
7.	margin: -5px 5px 0 0;
8.	padding: 0;
9.	text-align: center;
10.	width: 20px;
11.	}
Use a "-" shaped icon, white, when details are displayed:
1.	details[open] summary:after {
2.	content: "-";
3.	color: #FFFFFF
4.	}

1.4.2 The <time> and <mark> Elements
 
The <time> element
The <time> element is useful for marking a time or a duration in a document.
It provides both a human readable part (the part between <time> and </time>) and a machine readable part contained within a datetime attribute. Dates are expressed as YYYY-MM-DD.
The machine readable part adds semantics that can be used by search engines for indexing, by browsers or by browser extensions, or by JavaScript code. Useful scenarios include generating alerts for birthdays, automatically adding dates or events that contain <time> elements in a calendar, etc.
Example:
1.	We open at <time>10:00</time> every morning.
2.	
3.	I have a meeting the <time datetime="2020-02-14">Monday 14/02/2020.</time>.
4.	Blog posts from the year <time datetime="2020">2020</time>.
5.	Archives, blog posts for <time datetime="2020-04">April 2020</time>
6.	This recipe was published by Michel the <time datetime="2020-04-16">April 16, 2020</time>.
The datetime attribute
The datetime attribute can be used for indicating a date/time or a duration.
Date/time values
Supports different specifications of time such as "a year", "a month in a year", "a week in a year", "a time", etc... 

 
Here are some examples:
Different syntaxes of the datetime attribute
datetime attribute values	Interpretation
<time datetime="2020">	The year 2020
<time datetime="2020-11">	November 2020
<time datetime="11-13"> 	November 13th (any year)
<time datetime="2020-W21">	Week 21 from year 2020
<time datetime="2020-11-13 09:00">	November 13th year 2020, time = 9:00
<time datetime="2020-11-13T09:00">	Same as previous example, both syntaxes are supported, with and without the "T" between date and time.
<time datetime="09:00Z">	9:00 in the morning, GMT
<time datetime="09:00-05">	9:00 in the morning, GMT minus 5 hours
<time datetime="09:00+05:45">	9:00 in the morning, GMT plus 5 hours 45 minutes, (for example, Nepal is 5:45 ahead of  GMT)
Duration values
Duration values use the prefix “P” for “period” as in <time datetime="P4D"> (period = four days)...
 
So you start the attribute string value with a "P", followed by a duration value that ends with another letter indicating the unit used: "D" for "days",  “H” for hours, “M” for minutes and “S” for seconds. 
You can separate the different elements "P", value and unit with spaces, but this is optional. So <time datetime="P4D"> is a duration of 4 days, as is <time datetime="P 4 D">.
Using a “T” after the “P” marker allows you to indicate a more accurate duration time: <time datetime="PT4H 6M 12.55S"> is a duration of 4 hours, 6 minutes and 12.55 seconds.
Alternatively, you could use also a duration time component.
From Bruce Lawson's article : "Whichever you choose, it’s represented internally as a number of seconds. Because of this, you can’t specify a duration in terms of months, because a month isn’t a precise number of seconds; a month can last from 28 to 31 days. Similarly, a year isn’t a precise number of seconds; it’s 12 months and February sometimes has an extra day.
You still can’t represent dates before the Christian era, as years can’t be negative. Neither can you indicate date ranges. To mark up From “21/02/2012 to 25/02/2012″, use two separate <time> elements."
Examples:
<h2>Recipe:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Preparation time: <time datetime="PT30M">30 minutes</time> </li>
  <li> Cooking time:     <time datetime="PT10M">10 minutes</time> </li>
</ul>
The <time> element with no attributes
Used without attributes, the value between the opening <time> and closing </time> should follow the syntax given by the specification so that machines can understand it (same syntax as the one presented for the datetime attribute in the previous section). However it is recommended to use a datetime attribute, as it gives more freedom in the way you can display the date/time/duration in a human-readable form.

The <mark> element
 
The HTML <mark> tag is used for indicating text as marked or highlighted for reference purposes, due to its relevance in another context.
Some use cases:
•	Display search results with search strings highlighted in the results.
•	>Highlight important parts of a text, such as "quoting parts", etc.
•	Replace <strong> and <em> with <mark> when suitable.
Example 1: https://jsbin.com/tafelic/edit?html,output
Source code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset=utf-8 />
<title>JS Bin</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Project is due in <mark>.zip format</mark> next monday.</p>
</body>

Example 2:
 
Source code:
<body>
<pre>
<code><mark>var</mark> i = 3;</code>
</pre>
<p>The var keyword is used to declare a variable in JavaScript.</p>
</body>
Change the default style of the <mark> element
If you don't like the default yellow background, you may use CSS to change the style of the <mark> element:
For example:
 
... comes with this CSS rule:
1.	mark {
2.	    background-color: green;
3.	    color: yellow;

1.4.3 The Download and Translate Attributes
The old way to download files using HTML and HTTP
Everyone knows the classic way to make hyperlinks, using <a href="...">some text</a>. What happens when you click on the hyperlink depends on the MIME type received by the browser. If you link to a file the browser knows how to render (an html page, a gif, jpg, or png image, etc.) there is a good chance that the MIME type received by the browser will be something like this:
1.	Content-type: text/html, text/plain, image/gif, image/jpg, etc.
For example,  HTML code such as this:
1.	<a href="toto.jpg">
1.	    please right click this link to download
2.	    the toto.jpg picture</a>
...will ask the remote HTTP server to send back the toto.jpg file. The browser will receive in the response HTTP header from the server (and by default the browser will display the image in a new tab):
1.	...
2.	Content-type: image/jpg
3.	...
However, if the link points to some PHP code,  Java servlet code, or any kind of script/application on the server side, this remote server code can send in its HTTP response a Content-type that may force the browser to download the image instead of rendering it.
It may also propose a name for the file to be downloaded that may be different from the one that appears in the URL of the href attribute. This can be done by generating, in addition to the Content-type line in the response HTTP header, a Content-Disposition line that looks like this:
1.	Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="MyImage.png";
Here are some extracts from a Java Servlet that generate a zip file and forces the browser to propose downloading it using a specified name:
1.	protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
2.	throws ServletException, IOException {
3.	   try {
4.	     // Build the zip file
5.	       String path = getServletContext().getRealPath("data");
6.	       File directory = new File(path);
7.	       String[] files = directory.list();
8.	       if (files != null && files.length > 0) {
9.	         byte[] zip = zipFiles(directory, files);
10.	         ServletOutputStream sos = response.getOutputStream();
11.	
12.	         // generate a HTTP response that forces the download
13.	         response.setContentType("application/zip");
14.	         response.setHeader("Content-Disposition",
15.	                            "attachment; filename=\"DATA.ZIP\"");
16.	         sos.write(zip); sos.flush();
17.	       }
18.	    } catch (Exception e) {
19.	       e.printStackTrace();
20.	    }
21.	}
The above example will cause the browser that invoked this server-side code to start the download of a file named "DATA.ZIP".
To download a file using an arbitrary name: the download attribute
 
HTML5 proposes the use of a new attribute named download to download resources rather than navigating to them. The example below shows how to trigger the download of an image by the browser (instead of rendering it, which is the default behavior) with a name different from the name of the resource.
1.	<a href="normal.gif" download="MichelBuffa.gif">
2.	    download a picture of Michel Buffa
3.	</a>
This will indeed force the download of an image with a filename different from its original filename on the server side. Here is a screen capture of the Web browser while downloading the picture. We can see in the status bar the name of the link (the image is "normal.gif") and the downloaded file is "MichelBuffa.gif":
 
WARNING: since 2015, and for security reasons, the image should be located on the same domain as the HTML page that contains the link (using a relative URL works well, for example, but linking a page on another domain will not work - it will keep its original name).
Interesting applications: serverless download
 
Serverless download demo (by E.Bilderman)
This demo shows the use of the download attribute together with the HTML5 File, FileSystem and FileWriter APIs (to be studied later in this course) for generating on-the-fly content from JavaScript code, and proposing downloading it to a file.  
We won't detail this demo here, but take a look if you are curious to see what can be done with this new download attribute. As the FileWriter and FileSystem APIs are still supported only by Google Chrome (other browsers need polyfills), you will need Google Chrome to try it.
We have also put the simplified source code of this demo on JSBin.com for you to play with.

The HTML5 translate attribute
HTML5 gives us a new translate attribute. This attribute is used to limit the impact of  translation tools such as Google Translate by prohibiting the translation of certain content. In many cases some parts of a document should not be translated.
Use cases include:
o	HTML pages that contain source code: you would certainly not like to see the Java or PHP or whatever programming language parts of your page translated into another spoken language!
o	Video game Web sites that propose cheat codes; the codes do not have to be translated,
o	Street names, author names in an "about" page must not be translated,
o	etc.
Both Google translate and Microsoft online translation services already offer the ability to prevent translation of content by adding markup to your content, although they do it in (multiple) different ways. Hopefully, the new attribute will help significantly by providing a standard approach.
Principle: give hints to translating tools
The specification about the translate attribute tells us that  "The translate attribute is an enumerated attribute that is used to specify whether an element's attribute values and the values of its Text node children are to be translated when the page is localized, or whether to leave them unchanged.
The attribute's keywords are the empty string, yes, and no. The empty string and the yes keyword map to the yes state. The no keyword maps to the no state. In addition, there is a third state, the inherit state, which is the missing value default (and the invalid value default)."
Example illustrating how to specify parts of an HTML element that should not be translated:
1.	<span translate="no" class="author">Michel Ham</span>
In the above example, a <span> element defines an author (of a blog, for example) who is named Michel Ham. However, his family name is the same as pork and would be translated to "Michel Jambon" in French, or Michel Jamón in Spanish...
Using the translate="no" attribute should prevent this behavior...
1.	<span translate="no" class="author">Michel Ham</span> is a professor
2.	from the University of Nice,France.
Will be correctly translated into French by:
1.	"Michel Ham est un professeur de l'Université de Nice, France."
...where all of the end of the sentence has been translated except the author's name.
Inheritance between elements
When you define an element as not being translatable, its children inherit this behavior and are themselves not translatable. The reverse is also true. 
1.	<p translate="no">This is a text in a paragraph element, that should not be translated: the p element has a translate="no" attribute.<span> This part that is in a span element embedded within the paragraph. It does not have a translate attribute but inherits the translation-mode of the p and will not be translated too</span>. This is the end of the paragraph...</ p>

1.5 Microdata
There are several ways to provide machine-readable content embedded in a classical Web document: HTML+RDFa, microformats, JSON-LD, HTML5 microdata. In this section, we focus on microdata.
Adding microdata to Web pages helps search engines to better understand the pages' content, their topics, etc. The main purpose of microdata is Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
This information is not visible to humans: it is pure semantic information. Popular kinds of microdata are events, a person's profile, the description of an organization, the details of a recipe, a product description, a geographical location, etc. 
Quick example of microdata that describes a person
1.	<section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
2.	    <h1>Contact Information</h1>
3.	    <dl>
4.	      <dt>Name</dt>
5.	      <dd itemprop="name">Michel Buffa</dd>
6.	      <dt>Position</dt>
7.	      <dd><span itemprop="jobTitle">
8.	           Professor/Researcher/Scientist</span> for
9.	          <span itemprop="affiliation">
10.	              University of Côte d'Azur, France
11.	          </span>
12.	      </dd>
13.	    </dl>
14.	    <!-- SURFACE ADDRESS GOES HERE -->
15.	    <h1>My different online public accounts</h1>
16.	    <ul>
17.	       <li><a href="https://www.twitter.com/micbuffa"
18.	              itemprop="url">Twitter profile</a></li>
19.	       <li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/micbuffa"
20.	              itemprop="url">Michel Buffa's blog</a></li>
21.	    </ul>
22.	</section>
We can also add another embedded data item in the middle, such as the person's address:
1.	...
2.	</dl>
3.	
4.	<!-- SURFACE ADDRESS GOES HERE -->
5.	
6.	<dd itemprop="address" itemscope
7.	    itemtype="https://schema.org/PostalAddress">
8.	    <span itemprop="streetAddress">10 promenade des anglais</span><br>
9.	    <span itemprop="addressLocality">Nice</span>,
10.	    <span itemprop="addressRegion">Alpes maritimes, France</span>
11.	    <span itemprop="postalCode">06410</span><br>
12.	    <span itemprop="addressCountry" itemscope
13.	          itemtype="https://schema.org/Country">
14.	         <span itemprop="name">France</span>
15.	    </span>
16.	</dd>
17.	
18.	<h1>My different online public accounts</h1>
19.	
20.	...
In the following sections, we look more closely at the itemprop, itemscope and itemtype attributes.
Data that can be processed, organized, structured, or presented in a given context
Different use cases:
o	The browser, or a browser extension, may interpret the last example as an address and may propose to send it to a map application,
o	A Web crawler may interpret this as an address and display it in its responses using a dedicated presentation layout,
o	Some JavaScript code in the page can access this data,
o	With other types of microdata, for events, for example, the browser may pop up a calendar application, etc.
Note: For advanced users, Microdata is very similar to microformats, which use HTML classes, or to RDFa, which doesn’t validate in HTML4 or HTML5. Because RDFa was considered to be too hard for authors to write, microdata is HTML5's answer to help embed semantics into html documents.

1.5.2 Testing Tools
Introduction
After seeing the principle of embedding microdata in an HTML page, we now present some structured data test tools you can use to check if your data are correct.
 
One of the most popular resources for testing microdata (as well as microformats and RDFa) is this Google page about understanding how structured data works. This page contains a link to a structured data testing tool that you can use to see how Google recognizes the semantic data you embed in your HTML code.
Testing a real interactive example with an "about page" for Michel Buffa
Let's have a look now at a (small) example of an about page. It renders as a very simple paragraph that explains who Michel Buffa is... But we embedded Microdata, so it's interesting to see how a search engine sees it, and how it may produce "augmented search results".

Here is what Google sees of the page. We just entered its URL in the Google page about rich snippets and structured data:
 
Note that the address is a fully featured embedded object in the Person's description.

The Live Microdata Web site  is a bit similar to the previous one except that it shows the extracted metadata as JSON objects: 
 
And the JSON view of the microdata:
 
1.5.3 Adding Microdata to an HTML Page
Basic steps
Adding microdata to an HTML page is a really simple task and requires only three attributes: itemscope, itemtype  and itemprop.
1 - Define a container element by adding an itemscope attribute
First, you need to add an itemscope attribute to an HTML element. This will define the "global object" for which we will define properties. This element can be of different types that we will describe later, but for now let us keep looking at the same example we used in previous sections:
1.	<section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
2.	...
3.	</section>
We will look at the itemtype attribute later. Now that we have defined a global wrapper object/element (a Person in this case), we can  add properties inside this element to define the first name, last name, etc.
2 - Specify the vocabulary used for your microdata with the itemtype attribute of the container element
HTML5 proposes semantic elements for representing sections, articles, headers, etc, but it does not propose any specific elements or attributes to describe an address, a product, a person, etc.
We need a special vocabulary to represent a person or a physical address. With microdata you can define your own vocabulary or better, reuse one of the existing popular vocabularies, such as schema.org. 
Microdata works with properties defined as name/value pairs. The names are defined in the corresponding vocabulary. For example, the vocabulary for representing a Person defines a set of property names.
As you can see in this small extract from the vocabulary (also called a "schema"), a Person can have a name (some text), an Address (the type is defined by another vocabulary named PostalAddress), an affiliation (defined by another vocabulary named Organization) and so on.
We notice that one property, such as the address of a Person, may use another vocabulary. Yes, a vocabulary may link to another vocabulary! There is also inheritance between vocabularies! The above screenshot shows that the Person vocabulary inherits from a Thing vocabulary, and the five first properties of the table come from this vocabulary that describes things.
If you are a developer and if you are familiar with object oriented programming, think of properties as class attributes and think of vocabularies as classes.
Vocabularies are meant to be shared
 
If one of the existing vocabularies available at the schema.org Web site fits your needs, you should reuse it, as the most popular vocabularies are becoming de facto standards and will be taken into account by Web crawlers, browsers, and browser extensions.
However, if you do not find a vocabulary corresponding to your needs, keep in mind that anyone can define a microdata vocabulary and start embedding custom properties in their own Web pages. You need to define a namespace and put a description of your vocabulary in a Web page that has the name of your vocabulary.
3 - Add properties using the itemprop attribute in HTML elements inside the container
Basics:
Now that you have defined a container element, you may add properties to the HTML inside:
1.	<section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
2.	     <h1>Contact Information</h1>
3.	     <dl>
4.	         <dt>Name</dt>
5.	         <dd itemprop="name">Michel Buffa</dd>
6.	         <dt>Position</dt>
7.	         <dd><span itemprop="jobTitle">
8.	               Professor/Researcher/Scientist
9.	             </span> for
10.	             <span itemprop="affiliation">University of Nice,
11.	                    France
12.	             </span>
13.	          </dd>
14.	     </dl>
15.	     <h1>My different online public accounts</h1>
16.	     <ul>
17.	         <li><a href="https://www.twitter.com/micbuffa"
18.	             itemprop="url">Twitter profile</a></li>
19.	         <li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/micbuffa"
20.	             itemprop="url">Michel Buffa's blog</a></li>
21.	     </ul>
22.	</section>
In this example, the container is a <section> that corresponds to a Person (we have one clue here: the name of the vocabulary given by the itemtype attribute), and each property defined inside this section is identified by the value of the itemprop attribute of sub-elements.
The line: 
1.	<dd itemprop="name">Michel Buffa</dd>
...defines a property called "name" that has a value of "Michel Buffa" (the text value between the opening and closing tags of the <dd> element).
Nesting microdata items
As we saw with the Person/Address example at the beginning of this chapter, it is possible to nest microdata items inside one another.
Give an element inside a microdata container its own itemscope attribute with the recommended itemtype attribute for indicating the name of the vocabulary used by the nested microdata.
Again, look at the Person/Address example:
1.	...
2.	</dl>
3.	
4.	<!-- SURFACE ADDRESS GOES HERE -->
5.	
6.	<dd itemprop="address" itemscope
7.	    itemtype="https://schema.org/PostalAddress">
8.	     <span itemprop="streetAddress">10 promenade des anglais</span><br>
9.	     <span itemprop="addressLocality">Nice</span>,
10.	     <span itemprop="addressRegion">Alpes maritimes, France</span>
11.	     <span itemprop="postalCode">06410</span><br>
12.	     <span itemprop="addressCountry" itemscope
13.	           itemtype="https://schema.org/Country">
14.	          <span itemprop="name">France</span>
15.	     </span>
16.	</dd>
17.	
18.	<h1>My different online public accounts</h1>
19.	
20.	...
The properties at lines 8-12 refer to the address nested microdata (they are defined in the Address vocabulary, not the Person vocabulary), and "France" (line 14) is a property that refers to the Country vocabulary.
Several properties with the same name but different values
It is possible to use the same property name several times in one microdata object, but with different values:
1.	...
2.	<h1>My different online public accounts</h1>
3.	<ul>
4.	<li><a href="https://www.twitter.com/micbuffa" itemprop="url">Twitter
5.	      profile</a></li>
6.	<li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/micbuffa" itemprop="url">Michel
7.	      Buffa's blog</a></li>
8.	</ul>
This defines the fact that Michel Buffa has two online accounts, and the two properties have the name url, each with its own value.
It is possible to set more than one property at once, with the same value
Here are some microdata that represent a song. In this example, at line 5 we set  two different properties: genre and keywords with the same value (see the MusicRecording schema definition):
1.	<div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/MusicRecording">
2.	<h2>The song I just published</h2>
3.	<ul>
4.	<li>Name: <span itemprop="name">Please buy me on itunes, I need money!</span></li>
5.	<li>Band: <span itemprop="genre keywords">Punk, Ska</span></li>
6.	</ul>
7.	</div>
And so on...
Now, let's see what elements are compatible with the itemprop attribute and where the values of the properties are located, depending on each element type.
The HTML elements compatible with the itemprop attribute
If the itemprop attribute appears on a:
Elements that can be associated with microdata
HTML5 elements	microdata value associated
<a>, <area>, <audio>, <embed>, <iframe>, 
<img>, <link>, <object>, <source>, or <video> 
element	The data is the url in the element's href, src, or data attribute, as appropriate. For example, an image element inside a container of personal contact information can be recognized as that person's photo and downloaded accordingly.
<time> element	The data is the time in the element's datetime attribute. This lets you, for example, just say "last week" in your text content but still indicate exact date and time.
<meta> element	The data is whatever appears in the content attribute of the <meta> element. This is used when you need to include some data that isn't actually in the text of your page.
anything else	The data is whatever is in the text of the element.

For example, the value of a property defined in an <img> element will be the value of the src attribute:
<img itemprop="image" src="MichelBuffa.png" alt="A great professor">
Or for a <time>, it will be the value of the datetime attribute:
<time itemprop="birthday" datetime="1965-04-16">April 16, 1965</time>
Or for an <a> element, the value will be the value of the href attribute:
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/micbuffa" itemprop="url">profile</a>
1.5.4 Microdata Tools
There are many tools available (most are free) that you can use for generating, visualizing and debugging microdata. We list some of them in this page, but feel free to share the tools you find / like in the forums.
Microdata generators
To automatically generate microdata for describing persons, restaurants, movies, products, organizations, etc., there is a wide variety of microdata generators such as these listed below (but do not hesitate to search for "microdata generators" using your favorite search engine, and you will find lots!):

1.5.5 Examples of Well Structured Documents with Microdata
Here, we propose a few links to Web pages that were created by students of previous editions of this course).
The students had to create a Web page to introduce themselves, with some information including: name, job, employer, location, etc., and of course enrich the page with microdata. They also had to follow the best practices concerning the new structural elements, headings, etc.
